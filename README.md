# House_Price_PredictIon
Using Advance Regression
In my journey to becoming a Professional, I embarked on a captivating project to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques. This project allowed me to apply cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to real-world data, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

**Project Highlights:**

📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I conducted a comprehensive EDA to gain insights into the dataset, uncovering valuable patterns and relationships between various features such as square footage, neighborhood, and year of construction.

🧰 **Feature Engineering:** To improve model accuracy, I engineered new features, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables effectively and Handling outliers. This process significantly enhanced the quality of the dataset.

🏠 **Model Selection:** I experimented with multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and Gradient Boosting. By carefully evaluating their performance, I identified the most suitable algorithm for the task.

📈 **Model Evaluation:** Employing advanced evaluation metrics, I assessed model performance to ensure accurate predictions. I also implemented cross-validation techniques to prevent overfitting and optimize hyperparameters.

🔮 **Predictive Modeling:** The culmination of this project was the development of a robust predictive model that accurately estimated house prices. This model is now a valuable asset for anyone seeking to make informed decisions in the real estate market.

📊 **Result:** The Gradient Boost hyperparameter model has the highest R2 Score = 90 % and Adjusted R2 = 89.9 % among all the models evaluated. It also has a relatively low Mean Absolute Error (16367) and Mean Square Error (5.942590e+08), indicating better accuracy in predicting the target variable.

I used Linear Regression , Random forest and XG - Boost model which gives R2 Score of 86 % .

Therefore, I would suggest the Gradient Boost Hyperparameter model for deployment.
